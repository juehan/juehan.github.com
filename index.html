					Korean cultural background, of course not North Korean :)
				</p>
				<p class="big"> 					
					Once I was a cheerful working holiday maker in Australia around mid 1990's when I was uni student. One day right after I completed my 2 years of military service, I happened to be curious about life of others in differenent country. That's why I came to down under and then I				I rapidly fell in love with aussie's diversity and multicultural aspect as well as good combination of nature and modern cities.
					Behind my immigration decision, there is the my love for life style of Australia. So far, so good! (not always though. lol)
