					Thanks for coming and welcome to my webpage.

				<p class="big">
					My name is <em class="normal">Juehan Lee</em> or simply <em class="normal">John Lee</em>.
				</p>
				<p class="big">
					<em class="normal">Personally</em>, I am permanent resident of Australia as a skilled migrant with
					Korean cultural background, surely not North Korea :)
				</p>
				<p class="big"> 					
					I had been a working holiday maker in Aussie around mid 1990's when I was uni student. 
					I rapidly fell in love with aussie's diversity and multicultural aspect as well as good combination of nature and modern city.
					My immigration decision is the baby of my love with Australia. So far, so good!

				<p class="big">	
					Before I come to Australia, I have worked at Samsung Electronics R&amp;D Centre in Korea for about 8 years. 
					Now I am living in Sydney with my family.

					I also have a keen interest in what brings innovation in history and how Information Technology can contribute it.

I am not too bad at mining information from unordered data (Korean information search competition winner, 2007) and have over 20 (only google searchable) international patents under my name covering from IP network to multimedia solution.
